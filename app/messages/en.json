    "BACKGROUND": {
      "P1": "In the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), there are 10,246 factories with total investment exceeding 3 trillion THB and more than 650,000 workers. About 2,400 factories handle hazardous chemicals.",
      "P2": "From January to November 2023, 391 new factory licenses were granted in the EEC.",
      "P3": "Located in Chachoengsao (<num>{c1}</num>), Chonburi (<num>{c2}</num>), and Rayong (<num>{c3}</num>).",
      "P4": "Total investment is <num>{invest}</num> million THB with <num>{workers}</num> workers.",
      "P5": "The Sustainable Chemistry approach is explored for feasibility in driving the EEC, prioritizing safety in chemical use.",
      "BULLETS": {
        "1": "Chemical use should minimize toxicity or harm to people involved in production.",
        "2": "Prevent and reduce releases of toxic chemicals to the environmentâ€”whether as raw materials or substances used in processes."
      }
    },
    "OBJECTIVES": {
      "1": "Promote eco-friendly industrial investment by raising awareness of chemical safety and sustainable chemical use in the EEC.",
      "2": "Support Carbon Neutrality and Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions in the EEC.",
      "3": "Promote local safety measures and safer substitutions to build investor confidence and add value across the supply chain.",
      "4": "Enhance the capacity of operators, workers, regulators, and stakeholders to work safely with chemicals in normal and emergency situations."
